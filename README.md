# Stephen Riley

I'm a TypeScript developer based in Manchester, UK, specialising in modern
front-end and Node.js development. I focus on building scalable, high-performance
applications with clean architecture and intelligent design.

With deep expertise in Vue, TypeScript, and full-stack development, I’ve
delivered robust solutions across finance, media, e-commerce, and e-learning.
My work often involves integrating AI technologies from chatbots to automation
tools to create smarter, more responsive user experiences.

I care deeply about writing maintainable code, designing systems that scale,
and collaborating with teams to bring thoughtful products to life. Whether
you're building something new or refining an existing platform, I bring clarity,
precision, and a passion for solving real-world problems with elegant code.
