      Hello! I’m Ste, a full-stack web engineer based in the UK with a strong
      background in frontend development and a growing focus on AI-powered
      experiences. I’ve spent years crafting interfaces, leading engineering
      work, and recently diving deep into building agentic chatbots and
      generative UI systems.<br /><br />
      My journey into development has taken me from hands-on frontend engineering
      to becoming a lead engineer, guiding projects, mentoring others, and shaping
      how teams build modern web products. Over the last couple of years, I’ve had
      the chance to work extensively with emerging AI tooling — from the Vercel AI
      SDK to SkyBridge and MCP-UI — exploring how UI can adapt, generate, and evolve
      in real time.<br /><br />
      Today, I’m focused on creating smarter, more intuitive user experiences and
      pushing the boundaries of what the modern web can do with AI at its core.
